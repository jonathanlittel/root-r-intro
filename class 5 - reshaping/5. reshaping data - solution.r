# load libraries
library(dplyr) # for general manipulation
library(tidyr) # for reshaping with 'gather'
library(xlsx)  # for reading/writing excel files

# first, take a look at this article on reshaping:
# https://blog.rstudio.org/2014/07/22/introducing-tidyr/

# load rev data from social scorecards/alex db (from 1999 - 2015)
# pick one of the two methods for reading the data
filename1 <- 'client_revenue_alex.csv'  # from a folder
filename2 <- 'https://rootcapital.box.com/shared/static/4xi2sgwswfl26nllticutooawq5ho5el.csv' # direct from box
rev <- read.csv(filename2, skip=1)   # skip the first row, since we don't need it

# format data
rev <- rev[-nrow(rev)] # remove the last row 'grand total'

# look at the dota
head(rev)

# select only the columns Account.Name, and from rev_1996 to rev_2014
rev <-  select(rev, Account.Name, rev_1996:rev_2014) 

# reshape long to wide using 'gather'
rev_long <- gather(rev, Year, revenue, rev_1996:rev_2014)

# remove the stub 'rev_' from 'rev_YYYY'  
rev_long$Year <- as.numeric(gsub('rev_', '', rev_long$Year))

# extra credit:
# try doing both steps at once, using %>%
# select and reshape long to wide  
rev_long <- rev %>%
  select(Account.Name, rev_1996:rev_2014) %>%
  gather(Year, revenue, rev_1996:rev_2014)

# look at the output
head(rev_long)

# write output
out <- rev_long
write.csv(out, 'revenue_long.csv')
file.show('revenue_long.csv')


# go back from long form, to wide form
rev_wide <- spread(rev_long, Year, revenue)
head(rev_wide)

# optional: write output to xlsx  
# sheetname <- 'revenue'
# write.xlsx(out, 'revenue_long.xlsx', sheetName = sheetname) # showNA = FALSE to leave NA values as empty cells
# file.show('revenue_long.xlsx')
